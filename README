What's in here:

tracker_Linux.c -- the 'official'linux client. NB: only the
master version as distributed upstream is untouched.
Any of my alterations are unofficial and unsupported.

blseq2plt.py -- Python script to parse a logfile (generated with -e
command line to the tracker) and pull out the BLSEQ strings. It then
splits up the string into the 2 data streams (depending on version) and
feeds output to gnuplot
